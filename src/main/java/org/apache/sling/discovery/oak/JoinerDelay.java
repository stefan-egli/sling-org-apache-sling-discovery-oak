/**
 * The JoinerDelay is an ClusterSyncService used in the sync chain and got
 * introduced as part of SLING-10489.
 * <p/>
 * With SLING-10489 new-joining instances are ignored/suppressed by existing
 * instances in the cluster as long as they are potentially only partially
 * started up. The definition of partial-vs-full is the when everything
 * is written and the consistencyService (sync) would succeed. In other words
 * it includes: lease update / idMap / leaderElectionId / syncToken.
 * It is undefined how long a startup lasts and to avoid blocking other instances
 * from operating under a well-defined topology, the notion of ignoring/suppressing
 * partially started instances has been introduced.
 * <p/>
 * Generally speaking there are the following different cases wrt changes
 * in the local cluster:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>only properties change -&gt; that is handled separately already and not interesting here</li>
 *  <li>only leaving instances -&gt; not interesting for this problem</li>
 *  <li>only joining instances: in this case, these joining instances get
 *      ignored/suppressed until they are fully started and have written all needed discovery data.
 *      Until that has happened, the existing instances don't do anything discovery-related
 *      yet, ie they don't store syncToken yet neither. Thus, the newly joined instances,
 *      once they are finished with the startup, they would have to wait for the
 *      existing ones to yet take note of their full startup, of them writing their own
 *      sync token, so that the new-joiners can see those sync tokens and finish.
 *      So this case is perfectly fine simply with ignoring/suppressing.</li>
 *  <li>some leaving, some joining instances: it is this case which is a bit more tricky:
 *      with SLING-10489 the joining instances are now ignored/suppressed until they
 *      are fully started, so upon a cluster change they don't trigger any discovery
 *      activity on the existing instances.
 *      However, because there are also some instances leaving, the existing instances
 *      will take note of a cluster change and *therefore* update the syncToken etc.
 *      In that case, we have a new situation: the cluster change has been
 *      announced in the existing instances, the existing instances wrote their new
 *      sync token, but the new-joiners are still partially starting up.
 *      Let's say now the new-joiners finish their startup, so they write down the
 *      sync token. In that very moment the following happens concurrently:
 *      (a) the new-joiners check the topology and notice that everybody else already
 *      wrote the new sync token, so they can immediately go ahead and do a TOPOLOGY_INIT.
 *      (b) the existing instances just now stop ignoring/suppressing the new-joiners
 *      and then go through the consistencyService/syncing - but before they can do that,
 *      they have to inform existing listeners with a TOPOLOGY_CHANGING. Since that
 *      might take a while, it is realistic that the new-joiner already thinks they
 *      are in the new topology *while* the existing ones haven't received
 *      a TOPOLOGY_CHANGING event yet. And voila, we have a sort of short-lived split-brain.
 *      Now usually this should really only be very short-lived, as all that is holding
 *      bak is TopologyEventListeners reacting to TOPOLOGY_CHANGING - plus then some
 *      repository writes. So all of that shouldn't take too long. But it could be a few
 *      seconds. And the aim of discovery is to provide guarantees that there are never
 *      different topologies in the , aehm .., topology.
 *      Now to fix this, we'd have to probably do another synching, which would be
 *      unfeasibly complicated.
 *      But there's a rather simple way out: we can artificially delay the new-joiners
 *      from sending their very first TOPOLOGY_INIT. That way, if that delay is
 *      bigger than the above described race-condition, things would be fine.
 *      And that's what this JoinerDelay is about : delay new-joiner's TOPOLOGY_INIT.</li>
 * </ul>
